# Your Store in Progress

## What is this?

Your Store in Progress is a fake eCommerce store made for my portfolio. This project includes the following technologies.

* **React** (Framework)
* **Redux** (Global State Management)
* **Styled-Components** (Styling)
* **Bootstrap** (Additional Styling)
* **Cypress** (End to end Testing)

## What can it do?

Your store in Progress allows the user to search a collection of *products* which can be filtered by departments, or even using the search field at the top of the page. The user can also click on a product to view additional information. There is a cart feature that allows the user to add items they wish to purchase. From the cart the user can decide on the number of items to purchase, or if they wish to remove the item.
